# Assembly-Pyramid
This is a class project I completed in Assembly code using NASM Assembler wherein various disks on a peg are recursively sorted based on their size and the process is visualized. 

The execution requires one command line argument which determines the number of disks and the range of pegs on the disk. The user must press enter at each step of the visualization for the progress to continue.
